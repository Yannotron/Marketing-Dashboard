## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly.

### How to Report

**Please do NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report security vulnerabilities by:

1. **Email**: Send details to [security@yourcompany.com](mailto:security@yourcompany.com)
2. **GitHub Security Advisories**: Use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting feature
3. **Direct Contact**: Contact the maintainers directly if you have their contact information

### What to Include

When reporting a vulnerability, please include:

- **Description**: A clear description of the vulnerability
- **Steps to Reproduce**: Detailed steps to reproduce the issue
- **Impact**: Potential impact and severity assessment
- **Affected Versions**: Which versions are affected
- **Suggested Fix**: If you have suggestions for fixing the issue
- **Your Contact Information**: How we can reach you for follow-up

### Response Timeline

- **Acknowledgment**: Within 48 hours of receiving your report
- **Initial Assessment**: Within 7 days
- **Resolution**: Depends on severity, but we aim for:
  - Critical: 24-48 hours
  - High: 1-2 weeks
  - Medium: 2-4 weeks
  - Low: Next scheduled release

### Recognition

We appreciate security researchers who help us improve our security. We will:

- Credit you in our security advisories (unless you prefer to remain anonymous)
- Add you to our security hall of fame
- Consider bug bounties for significant vulnerabilities (case by case)

## Security Measures

### Data Protection

- **PII Stripping**: All personal information (emails, phone numbers) is stripped from data before external display
- **Data Minimization**: We only collect and store necessary data
- **Encryption**: All data is encrypted in transit and at rest
- **Access Controls**: Strict access controls and authentication

### Code Security

- **Dependency Scanning**: Regular automated scanning for vulnerable dependencies
- **Code Review**: All code changes require security review
- **Static Analysis**: Automated security analysis in CI/CD pipeline
- **Input Validation**: All user inputs are validated and sanitized

### Infrastructure Security

- **Environment Separation**: Clear separation between dev, test, and production environments
- **Secret Management**: All secrets managed through secure systems (GitHub Secrets, environment variables)
- **Network Security**: Proper network segmentation and firewall rules
- **Monitoring**: Continuous security monitoring and alerting

## Security Best Practices

### For Developers

1. **Never commit secrets** to version control
2. **Use environment variables** for configuration
3. **Validate all inputs** from external sources
4. **Keep dependencies updated** regularly
5. **Follow secure coding practices**
6. **Use HTTPS** for all communications
7. **Implement proper error handling** without exposing sensitive information

### For Users

1. **Keep your software updated** to the latest version
2. **Use strong, unique passwords**
3. **Enable two-factor authentication** where available
4. **Be cautious with data sharing**
5. **Report suspicious activity** immediately

## Dependency Updates

### Automated Updates

We use automated tools to monitor and update dependencies:

- **Dependabot**: Automated pull requests for dependency updates
- **GitHub Security Advisories**: Automatic alerts for known vulnerabilities
- **Renovate**: Automated dependency updates with testing

### Manual Review Process

All dependency updates go through:

1. **Automated Testing**: Full test suite must pass
2. **Security Review**: Check for known vulnerabilities
3. **Breaking Changes**: Assess impact of major version updates
4. **Performance Impact**: Ensure no performance regressions

### Update Schedule

- **Critical Security Updates**: Immediate (within 24 hours)
- **High Priority Updates**: Within 1 week
- **Regular Updates**: Monthly
- **Major Version Updates**: Quarterly with thorough testing

## Security Tools

### Static Analysis

- **ESLint Security Plugin**: JavaScript/TypeScript security rules
- **Bandit**: Python security linter
- **Semgrep**: Multi-language security analysis
- **CodeQL**: GitHub's semantic code analysis

### Dependency Scanning

- **npm audit**: Node.js dependency vulnerabilities
- **pip audit**: Python package vulnerabilities
- **GitHub Dependabot**: Automated dependency updates
- **Snyk**: Comprehensive vulnerability scanning

### Runtime Security

- **Content Security Policy (CSP)**: XSS protection
- **Subresource Integrity (SRI)**: Resource integrity verification
- **HTTPS Everywhere**: Encrypted communications
- **Security Headers**: Comprehensive security headers

## Incident Response

### Response Team

- **Security Lead**: [Name] - [email]
- **Technical Lead**: [Name] - [email]
- **Operations Lead**: [Name] - [email]

### Response Process

1. **Detection**: Monitor for security incidents
2. **Assessment**: Evaluate severity and impact
3. **Containment**: Isolate affected systems
4. **Eradication**: Remove threat and vulnerabilities
5. **Recovery**: Restore normal operations
6. **Lessons Learned**: Document and improve

### Communication

- **Internal**: Immediate notification to security team
- **Users**: Notification within 24 hours for critical issues
- **Public**: Coordinated disclosure following responsible disclosure principles

## Compliance

### Data Protection
