# How To Use These Guides in Cursor

1) Pin `01_workspace_guardrails.mdc` as your persistent workspace/system prompt.
2) Keep `02_workflow_plan_and_checks.mdc` open and reference it when starting changes.
3) Use `06_task_prompts.mdc` to kick off each task (feature, refactor, bugfix, migration).
4) Apply `03_security_and_env.mdc` rules to any code touching IO, deps, or config.
5) Use `04_pr_template.mdc` as your PR template.
6) In CI, call the prompt in `05_ci_llm_evaluator.mdc` to score patches (pairwise or single).
7) Enforce `07_quality_bar.mdc` before merging.
